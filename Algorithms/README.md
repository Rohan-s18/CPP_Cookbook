# Algorithms
## Author: Rohan Singh
This directory contains source code for basic algorithm stuff in C++

This directory is divided into sub-direcotries based on the class of algorithm.

## Algorithm Types
The sub-directories of the different algorithm times are:  
  - **Sorting:** Contains Source Code for Sorting Algorithms.  
  - **Greedy:** Contains Source Code for Greedy Algorithms.   
  - **Divided and Conquer:** Contains Source Code for Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms.   
  - **Dynamic Prigramming:** Contains Source Code for Dynammic Programming Algorithms.
